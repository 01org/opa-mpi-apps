This directory contains versions of the BLAS library developed by
Kazushige Goto.  More details about this library can be found at:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/goto

For each architecture a single default library is linked to libgoto.so
The Make.ICS.`uname -s` file fill use libgoto.so.  If a different default
is desired, the symbolic link can be changed.

A xerbla.o file is also supplied along with the source file from which it
was generated.  This file is needed by libgoto to satisfy a few OS specific
references.

architectures are as follows:
amd64 - Linux 64 bit Opteron systems
i686 - Linux 32 bit Intel Pentium and AMD Athlon series
em64t - Linux 64 bit Intel Nocona series (Xeon with EM64T)
ia64 - Linux Intel Itanium
Darwin - MAC OS X with PPC
ppc - Linux Power PC 970
